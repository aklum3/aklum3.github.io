## The Basics
If you think about almost any task or problem, in order to obtain a solution, a certain procedure is usually used.  Whether this is a step-by-step procedure similar to the scientific method - which starts with a question, then a hypothesis is formed, which eventually continues to move into an experient, and ends with a conclusion - or something more specfifc such as algorithms for sorting: chronological, alphabetical, etc.  Either way, a format is used and this is because it has proven to be succesful in producing an accurate outcome in comparison to its counter-parts.  Implementing this ideology into coding, design patterns are an effective way to obtain an organized program.  A good comparison that describes design patterns is they are to coding as blueprints are to buildings.  They provide a structure for the user to follow that are usually the best practices used by other developers.  There are many different design patterns used in coding, each having their own function.

## Implementation
If I have ever used design patterns with coding I wan unaware I was following one.
