## The Classic Cliché
Many people are familiar with the popular saying that there is no such thing as a stupid question.  And although there may be some truth in that statement, I believe there is a distinct difference in a smart way to ask a question and a ‘not smart’ way to ask a question.  People ask questions to clarify or learn more about a topic they are not familiar with.  I think it is unfair for people to expect everyone to be as knowledgeable as them in a certain topic.  But the way a question is formatted can influence the way people perceive it, either as a smart question or not.  It is important that software engineers know the difference between the two because asking questions for help with work is inevitable and being able to utilize smart questions can result in constructive answers.

## How to Get Answers
When asking public questions on the web, there tends to be a pattern in the questions that receive constructive answers and those that do not.  For an example of a smart question, I found someone on the question and answer website Stack Overflow asking [how to generate random integers withing a specific range in Java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/363681/how-do-i-generate-random-integers-within-a-specific-range-in-java).  In the post, the user asks how they would go about generating a random number and provides two short snippets of code that they tried.  I chose this as an example as a smart question because it shows that the person put in some research and has attempted to solve the problem before posting their question.  People are more inclined to respond when the questioner shows that they have put in some effort into solving the problem before asking for help and clearly describes the process they went through.  The question has numerous responses that are incredibly detailed in different options the user could take to solving their problem and majority of the answers appear to be courteous.
