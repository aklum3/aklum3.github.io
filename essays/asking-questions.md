## The Classic Cliché
Many people are familiar with the popular saying that there is no such thing as a stupid question.  And although there may be some truth in that statement, I believe there is a distinct difference in a smart way to ask a question and a ‘not smart’ way to ask a question.  People ask questions to clarify or learn more about a topic they are not familiar with.  I think it is unfair for people to expect everyone to be as knowledgeable as them in a certain topic.  But the way a question is formatted can influence the way people perceive it, either as a smart question or not.  It is important that software engineers know the difference between the two because asking questions for help with work is inevitable and being able to utilize smart questions can result in constructive answers.

## How to Get Answers
When asking public questions on the web, there tends to be a pattern in the questions that receive constructive answers and those that do not.  For an example of a smart question, I found someone on the question and answer website Stack Overflow asking [how to generate random integers withing a specific range in Java](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/363681/how-do-i-generate-random-integers-within-a-specific-range-in-java).  In the post, the user asks how they would go about generating a random number and provides two short snippets of code that they tried.  I chose this as an example as a smart question because it shows that the person put in some research and has attempted to solve the problem before posting their question.  People are more inclined to respond when the questioner shows that they have put in some effort into solving the problem before asking for help and clearly describes the process they went through.  The question has numerous responses that are incredibly detailed in different options the user could take to solving their problem and majority of the answers appear to be courteous. 

## Smarter Way to Ask Questions?
I learned a lot about how to ask questions the smart way from reading an [essay](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) written by Eric Raymond.  The essay, in brief, is a guideline on how to interact with the online community.  A major take-away is knowing what components decide whether a question is smart or not.  I think one of the more interesting things I learned is that it is better to describe the goal rather than the step you are stuck on.  I think this can be overlooked sometimes and by describing the entire situation it allows the people answering to potentially suggest a better way to complete the task.  The essay also makes the point that homework questions should not be posted.  In [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1323830/relations-on-sets-homework) Stack Overflow question, the user states that they don’t know what to do, and just posts their homework question.  The user doesn’t show any signs of attempting the problem and the responses are reflective of the ‘smartness’ of the question.  The two answers to the question basically restate the question back the original user.  Overall, asking a question is better than not asking at all and never getting an answer, but being descriptive and having manners can be more beneficial when looking for help.
