## Semantic UI Journey
For the past week, I have been learning and testing out Semantic UI (user interface).  It has also been my first experience with using UI frameworks in general; additionally, prior to using Semantic UI, I only had around two weeks working with HTML (hypertext markup language).  According to [Semantic UI’s website](https://semantic-ui.com/), it “empowers designers and developers by creating a shared vocabulary for UI.”  Other than the three hours of tutorials I watched and the tedious tweaking and troubleshooting of code for the different variations of features, I think my overall opinion so far is still positive.  To summarize my experience, I think that it has been one of the most interesting but frustrating software features I have had to work with.

## The Learning Curve
I believe one of the main reasons people may be discouraged to try Semantic UI, or any other framework for that matter, may be the overwhelming amount of information to take in.  I feel that since a framework is basically a new “vocabulary” it can be comparable to the process of learning a new programming language.  As with learning anything new, UI frameworks will not always come easy; in fact, I think that Semantic UI specifically, has quite a steep learning curve.  It is fairly straight-forward and simple in the beginning to pick up the basics and how to use the various elements, but once the user tries applying everything in real situations where different variations are desired, it can start getting problematic.  There are no longer examples to follow along once components start mixing and the web page becomes more unique and complex.

## Achievable Advantages
After putting a considerable amount of time into Semantic UI, I think that I have an adequate understanding of how to build simple, but aesthetic websites.  If I had a choice to learn Semantic UI all again or continue with only using raw HTML and CSS (cascading style sheets), I would choose learning a framework.  I think the main benefit of utilizing a UI framework is that it simplifies the design process so that the user can quickly build a web page.  Although it takes some time to see satisfactory results, I can now comfortably use the framework and access its components anytime I am tasked with designing website.  Compared with using raw HTML to format information I think my build-time <em>massive</em>ly improved.  If you do try to learn Semantic UI and succeed, welcome to the other side, although it may have been a challenging journey, there is still more to come, you can always learn more and sharpen your skills when trying to implement new advanced features.
