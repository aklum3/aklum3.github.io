## My Experience
I have only been working with JavaScript for a couple weeks, but it has already left a considerable impression on me.  So far, my perspective of the language is quite positive.  My current knowledge in programming languages is limited to C and C++.  I would say that I am proficient with those two syntaxes and I have some experience with Python and Java.  Comparing JavaScript with C and C++, I think what grabs my attention the most is how forgiving it can be.  For example, formatting and continuity are very crucial in C/C++.  If a code is just missing one semicolon, the file will fail to compile.  On the other hand, in JavaScript there has been a few times where I catch a missing semicolon, but only after I have already tested the code several times.  If I had to choose a metaphor for the languages, I would say that C is like one of those stereotypical strict Asian parents who get angry if their child brings home an A- on an assignment and JavaScript is more like a grandparent who’s just proud you’re learning and trying your best.
