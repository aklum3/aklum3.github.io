## Coding Standards in JavaScript
After learning about and coding with JavaScript for almost a month, it has been an interesting transition switching over to the IntelliJ software - an integrated development environment (IDE).  Previously, I was using an online IDE which goes by the name JSfiddle.  Although there are many differences between the two, I think an interesting feature of IntelliJ is its ability to use plugins.  I have recently started using the ESLint plugin, which is a software tool that analyzes JavaScript code and claims to help maintain code quality.  The plugin helps maintain a certain standard for formatting by underlining any ‘errors’ with the all too familiar squiggly red line.  It gives the user a brief description of why the software is detecting a discrepancy.  It also lets the programmer know the total number of warnings in the top right corner and displays a reassuring green checkmark if the code is up to the coding standard criteria.

## Learning Assistant?
I believe that coding standards can be considered helpful in learning a new programming language.  When first learning a new programming language, I find that one of the most difficult things are remembering the syntax and formatting.  There is a whole other level of challenges for those who are already proficient in a different programming language; having to remember which libraries are from which language, moreover, each additional language a programmer knows can make it that much more confusing.  Apart from mixing up the languages, formatting is not always consistent across the board.  Although programming styles are not always a necessity, it can help keep the code neat and easy to understand for others, in almost all languages.

## Initial Impressions & Effectiveness
As for the effectiveness of ESLint, I think it has been extremely useful in my JavaScript journey.  Since I do not remember all of specific details about spacing and new lines, I find myself relying on ESLint to catch any mistakes I might make.  It helps me narrow down my problems to my algorithm and logic, rather than a simple mistake in my code such as an unexpected character or missing symbol.  I think the responses are very clear and help me understand exactly what I did wrong.  By correcting my mistakes and following the coding standard I am able to learn what to do next time in order to prevent ESLint from detecting a violation.  Overall, I would recommend using some type of assistant software that checks your code and identifies potential formatting problems because everyone can benefit from implementing coding standards.
