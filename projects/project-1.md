summary: Designed, constructed, and programmed an autonomous robot to find the center of a maze (awarded 1st place at UH Manoa competition for fastest time).
---

My team and I designed an autonomous robot - called a mouse - able to navigate a maze using a solving algorithm. We constructed the mouse using a self-designed PCB, 3D CADed chassis, a PIC microcontroller, stepper motors, and IR sensors. I also led my team in programming the mouseâ€™s movement, navigating, and solving algorithm in C.  Some of the code included interrupts (interrupt service routine) and an analog-to-digital convertor. We were awarded 1st place at UH Manoa's competition for fastest time to complete the maze.
