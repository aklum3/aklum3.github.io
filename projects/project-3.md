Along with fabricating a turn-based battle game implementing object-oriented programming, I delegated tasks to team members and kept the team updated on the applicationâ€™s progress.  We utilized C++ techniques to incorporate features such as unique character classes with stats (health, attack, speed) and moves as well as a targeting and attack order function.
